				<p>For this project, we sought to get our message in front of hard-to-reach audience segments in key states. We had incredible organic support through our Facebook community of advocates, but the places they lived didn't quite match up with the states where action from residents was most needed. Fueled by the insight that our best advocates had ties beyond their home states, we created a tool to help enable them to reach to members of their personal networks who lived in states with pending legislation.</p>

				<p>The landing page contained a few important legislative actions listed by state. After signing in, a user was encouraged to take any current actions in their own state but most importantly was presented with a list of friends impacted by each state action. From there they could easily reach out with a message encouraging that friend or loved one to take action. </p>

				 <p>An important piece of our solution was the module that contained the first group of friends in each state. Early on in the research and exploration phase we realized that some of our users could potentially have hundreds of friends listed under a given state. From there we decided that showing the full list at first would be problematic and that we needed to find a way to make the most from a very select list. We ultimately created an algorithm that sorted the friends list in a given state using attributes from the Facebook API and prioritizing friends who we considered to be most receptive or likely to act.</p>

				<p>Overall the project was a great success in empowering our most active supporters to help expand our community into the states that were hardest to reach using other tactics. I learned a ton from the developers at This by Them. They were super organized and helped me realize how valueable an iterative and collaborative approach was to finding the best solution to the problem at hand. Their  process of cycling through quick sprints helped us power through uncertainty and continually optimize to the needs of our end user. </p>
